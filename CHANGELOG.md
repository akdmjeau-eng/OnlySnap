## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Chat DRM Support:** Added suppart for downloading DRM-protected media from direct messages. *(Note: This feature is currently untested as I haven't encountered DRM-protected chat content to fully verify it yet).*
- **External API Update:** Updated the external backend API to properly handle and route license requests for encrypted chat messages using the `/drm/message/` endpoint.

### Fixed
- **Completion Message Crash:** Fixed a `NameError` crash caused by a typo (`total_global_failes` -> `total_global_files`) that occurred when no new files needed downloading.
- **Debug Logging:** Fixed an issue where debug logging would silently fail.
- **DRM Race Condition:** Fixed a critical race condition during parallel DRM downloads.
